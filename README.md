# React-Projects

## What's the Plan? 
My first react App - I created a simple TO-DO webpage. Inspired by rap-lord Wiz Khalifa

## Youtube Clone 
This took me a couple of days to do. I wanted to get the hand of redux so I did something stupid: Only use functional components and let redux do what its supposed to, and then some. I also wanted to sharpen up my css so I didn't use any UI imports.
